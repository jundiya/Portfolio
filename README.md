# Data Analytics Learning
These will be my portfolio of subject learning or projects leading to Data Analytics.

## Bellabeat: Case Study with R

In this case study, I performed many real-world tasks of a junior data analyst. From the scenario, Bellabeatâ€™s cofounder asked the marketing analytics team to focus on a Bellabeat product and analyze smart device usage data in order to gain insight into how people are already using their smart devices. Then, using this information, she would like high-level recommendations for how these trends can inform Bellabeat marketing strategy.
