These will be my portfolio of subject learning or projects leading to Data Analytics.

## Bellabeat: How Can a Wellness Technology Company Play It Smart? 

**Scenario:** Bellabeat’s cofounder asked the marketing analytics team to focus on a Bellabeat product and analyze smart device usage data in order to gain insight into how people are already using their smart devices. Then, using this information, she would like high-level recommendations for how these trends can inform Bellabeat marketing strategy. In this case study, I performed many real-world tasks of a junior data analyst.

## Cyclistic: How Does a Bike-Share Navigate Speedy Success?

**Scenario:** I was junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, my team wanted to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes diﬀerently. From these insights, my team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But ﬁrst, Cyclistic executives must approve my recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.

## Market Research and Recommendation and Visualization Technique for Business Decision Making

Using Python, I did churn analysis as market research project from one of sport store branch called DQLAB Sport Center. This store encountered a problem with decreased number of customers.
