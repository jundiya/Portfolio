# Data Analytics Learning
These will be my portfolio of subject learning or projects leading to Data Analytics.

## Bellabeat: How Can a Wellness Technology Company Play It Smart? 

In this case study, I performed many real-world tasks of a junior data analyst. From the scenario, Bellabeat’s cofounder asked the marketing analytics team to focus on a Bellabeat product and analyze smart device usage data in order to gain insight into how people are already using their smart devices. Then, using this information, she would like high-level recommendations for how these trends can inform Bellabeat marketing strategy.

## Cyclistic: How Does a Bike-Share Navigate Speedy Success?
From the scenario, I'm a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, my team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes diﬀerently. From these insights, my team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But ﬁrst, Cyclistic executives must approve your recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.
