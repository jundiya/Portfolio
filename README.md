# Learning Python
These will be my portfolio of subject learning or projects leading to Data Analytics.<br/>
### Market Research and Recommendation and Visualization Technique for Business Decision Making<br/>
This code can be broken down into three different tests: data preparation, data visualization, and basic stats method. Data preparation involves importing and cleansing data like datetime formatting and classify the churn customer.

Finally, basic stats method test to get insight from model and evaluate the model.

### Data Cleansing<br/>
